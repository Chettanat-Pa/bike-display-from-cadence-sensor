# bike-display-from-cadence-sensor
A project to creates a bicycle odometer & speedometer display on a 2-lines LCD screen using a cadence sensor.

The goals are to make a bike display system that's cheaper than what's in the markets. The other goal is to teach us how to work on a project from designing, parts selection, coding and mechanics of installation. Since this is the first for 3 of us working on a project.
In phase two, if time permit, we will add dynamo hub, with nighttime safety-light.
